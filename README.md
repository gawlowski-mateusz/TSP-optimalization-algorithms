# TSP optimalization algorithms

This repository contains implementations of my college course project named Projektowanie Efektywnych Algorytm√≥w - PEA (eng. Effective Algorithm Designing). It's focused on algorithms for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). 

## PEA_Project_Episode_1 - Exact Algorithms

1. **Brute Force**
   - [Code](https://github.com/gawlowski-mateusz/TSP-optimalization-algorithms/tree/main/PEA_Project_Episode_1/BruteForce)
   - **Description**: This algorithm solves the TSP by exhaustively checking all possible permutations of cities.

2. **Dynamic Programming**
   - [Code](https://github.com/gawlowski-mateusz/TSP-optimalization-algorithms/tree/main/PEA_Project_Episode_1/DynamicProgramming)
   - **Description**: Utilizes dynamic programming to solve TSP by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and solving them iteratively.

3. **Branch and Bound**
   - [Code](https://github.com/gawlowski-mateusz/TSP-optimalization-algorithms/tree/main/PEA_Project_Episode_1/BranchAndBound)
   - **Description**: Solves TSP by exploring branches of the search tree, pruning branches that cannot lead to an optimal solution.

## PEA_Project_Episode_2 - Metaheuristic Local Search Algorithms

1. **Tabu Search**
   - [Code](https://github.com/gawlowski-mateusz/TSP-optimalization-algorithms/tree/main/PEA_Project_Episode_2/TabuSearch)
   - **Description**: A metaheuristic algorithm that uses tabu lists to escape local optima during the search for the optimal solution.

2. **Simulated Annealing**
   - [Code](https://github.com/gawlowski-mateusz/TSP-optimalization-algorithms/tree/main/PEA_Project_Episode_2/SimulatedAnnealing)
   - **Description**: This algorithm simulates the annealing process in metallurgy to gradually reduce the search space and find the optimal solution.

## PEA_Project_Episode_3 - Population-based Metaheuristic Algorithms

1. **Genetic Algorithm**
   - [Code](https://github.com/gawlowski-mateusz/TSP-optimalization-algorithms/tree/main/PEA_Project_Episode_3/GeneticAlgorithm)
   - **Description**: Uses principles of natural selection and genetics to evolve a population of solutions towards the optimal solution for TSP.

## Reports
